# Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL)

This repository contains the code and trained models for the Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL) framework.

## Overview

DiSOL is a neural operator framework designed for geometry-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). 

## Repository Structure

- `Examples/` — Trained DiSOL models for each case study (Pytorch)
- `data_generation/` — Program for generate training data (MATLAB)

## Run the code

There are four different problems in the 'Examples' folder. Each folder contains training and testing codes, out-of-distribution test datasets, and a pretrained model. To run the code, please refer to the README.md in each folder.

## Dataset

All datasets used in this work are available in Zenodo at:
